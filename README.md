## Description
This article contains explanations about different types of queues and their uses. First, I find the topic to be important, as queues are a fundamental data structure so mastery of them is necessary. Secondly, I love the interactive demo of different queueing strategies, as it gives a visual intuition of why some approaches might be preffered to others. Additionally, this is applied to the context of serving HTTP requests, which is relevant both to this class, and to software engineering in general. The nice styling and colors are a big plus as well.

## Tahsin's Comment

I really liked the visualizations within this article. It made understanding these different queueing strategies a lot easier. I also liked how we could see visually that certain queues are better for different situations than other queues. Using queues for HTTP requests does help manage these requests efficiently, which is very important when we have many requests at once.
