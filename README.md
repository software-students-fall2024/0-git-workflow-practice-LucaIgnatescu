# Queueing, by Sam Rose

[Link](https://encore.dev/blog/queueing) to the article.

## Description
This article contains explanations about different types of queues and their uses. First, I find the topic to be important, as queues are a fundamental data structure so mastery of them is necessary. Secondly, I love the interactive demo of different queueing strategies, as it gives a visual intuition of why some approaches might be preffered to others. Additionally, this is applied to the context of serving HTTP requests, which is relevant both to this class, and to software engineering in general. The nice styling and colors are a big plus as well.

## Commit
This article mainly talked about queues, their types, and different use cases. This remind me the Basic Algo class when I see the FIFO and LIFO. That class also mentioned how queues are used on computer system and manage the processes, and what we usually use now is the priority queue. At the end, this article also talked about a real example: HTTP request, while FIFO is the usual case, the author believes LIFO or priority with AQM will be better.
